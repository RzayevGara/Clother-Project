              How We Got Here
            </h3>
            <p>
              Founder Katrina Lake created Clother to blend the human element of
              personal styling with high-quality clothing and proprietary
              algorithms. She shipped the first Clother order out of her
              Cambridge apartment in 2011 while attending Harvard, and today the
              company has brought the exclusive shopping experience to millions
              of men and women nationwide. In 2016, we launched men`s, and
              extended our women`s offerings to include plus sizes in 2017.
